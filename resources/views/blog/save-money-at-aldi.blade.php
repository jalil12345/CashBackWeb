    <h2 class="ms-5">Coupons</h2>
                <p>
                Aldi generally does not offer coupons in the traditional sense. Instead,
                 they focus on providing everyday
                 low prices on their products without the need for coupons or discounts. <br>
                 However, Aldi does occasionally offer limited-time promotions or discounts on select products.
                  These promotions are typically advertised in their weekly ad or on their website.
                </p>
<h2 class="ms-5">Gift Cards</h2>
                <p>
                Aldi offers gift cards that can be used to purchase items in-store. The gift cards are available in
                 denominations ranging from $5 to $100 and can be purchased at any Aldi store. <br>
                 It's worth noting that Aldi gift cards cannot be used to make online purchases or for delivery orders, 
                 and they cannot be used to purchase other gift cards or lottery tickets.
                  Additionally, the gift cards cannot be redeemed for cash or returned for a refund.

                </p>
<h2 class="ms-5">Loyalty Program</h2>
                <p>
                Aldi does not have a loyalty program, 
                they strive to provide value to their customers through low prices,
                 high-quality products.
                </p>
<h2 class="ms-5">Refund and Replacement</h2>
                <p>
                Aldi offers a satisfaction guarantee on all of their products. 
                If you are not satisfied with a product for any reason,
                 you can return it to the store for a full refund or replacement. <br>
                 It's worth noting that some perishable items, such as produce and meat,
                  may have a shorter return window due to their perishable nature. Additionally, 
                 some non-food items may have specific return policies, such as electronics or seasonal items.
